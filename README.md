# anki-subs

Modified version of ["Watch Foreign Language Movies with Anki"](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/939347702) to be used entirely in Anki, without external player while studying

Adds another note type with slightly different formatting and omitted script.

All credit to original creator ([repo](https://github.com/kelciour/movies2anki)), this is just a few modifications that I made for personal use
